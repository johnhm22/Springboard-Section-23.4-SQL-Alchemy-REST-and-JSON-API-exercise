# Springboard-Section-23.4-SQL-Alchemy-REST-and-JSON-API-exercise

This is another interesting coding exercise for students on the Software Engineering course from [Springboard](www.springboard.com)  
The focus this time is on creating and calling APIs based on the enticing product of cupcakes; through the frontend, you can view details of the current cupcakes and invent new ones  
The technologies used are HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python, Flask, Flaks SQL Alchemy and a PostreSQL database  
There is also a tests.py file for testing basic functionality
